![Overview](/docs/img/overview.png)

## Overview

**BPMN Architect** is a robust, lightweight, self-hosted Live BPMN Editor tailored for secure, real-time enterprise process modeling. Designed with a priority on data integrity, it uses local storage for `.bpmn` XML payloads and a centralized SQLite database for high-performance lock management and metadata handling.

This platform bridges the gap between sophisticated BPMN modeling via `bpmn.io` and zero-collision collaboration, ensuring a consistent and friction-free process mapping experience for your organization.

## Key Highlights

- 🔒 **Collision-Free Collaboration:** Heartbeat-based file locking ensures only one user edits a process at a time.
- 🎨 **Modern Interface:** A clean, responsive UI with a built-in Library, centralized Admin portal, and specialized embed modes.
- 🏢 **Enterprise Ready:** Architected to run securely behind Microsoft IIS with full Windows Authentication (Active Directory) support.
- 💾 **Decoupled Architecture:** Native integration for an overnight "cold backup" script connecting automatically to your Git repository.
